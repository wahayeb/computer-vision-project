# computer-vision-project
The goal of this project is to determine the difference between keratoconus and natural cornea. 
Keratoconus is a pathological condition caused by impaired collagen fibres in the cornea, 
resulting in a cone-like shape. The model was trained to recognise and distinguish both healthy 
and corneal corneas affected by keratoconus. This tool can be used in the field of ophthalmology to facilitate early 
detection and serve doctors in the diagnosis of keratoconus, ultimately benefitting patient care
